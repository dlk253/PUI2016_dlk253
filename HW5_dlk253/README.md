#HW5
This week I finally felt comfortable witht he realtionship between compute and github. It now makes sense to me and I have been able to push my data with no problems. On Friday I met with my group and we worked through assignment 1 and 2. The plotting is interestinga I was sometimes getting some obsecure visuals. The null hypothesis in all my cases for assignment 2 was rejected.I am also taking a deep dive into the online stats book and it is helpful. I have never taken a stats course before so I need to catch up on knowledge of distributions and the relevant equations. 

#Assignment 1 and Assignment 2
For these first two assignments I worked with Jon Toy, Bailey Griswold, Christian Rosado, and Adrian Dahlin. We were all pretty comfortable with this one and it again was super helpful to work with the group. As the artist in the group I am the outlier and am often asking questions and having a little trouble keeping up but the group is very good at explaining things and I am learning so much.
After the work session I went right to my stats book and started reading. 

#Assignment 3: 
Practice formulating the null hypothesis. For this part of the assignment I worked with Greg Mayes. He is an engineer and works for the DEP and I sent him the version of this in words and he rejected the first two and added the equations for all four. We worked together and I appreciate his ability to come up with these so quickly. 

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

##H0 = The % of fat lost in adults who dieted during the study period is the same or lower than those who exercised during the same period.

##Control sample = % of fat lost by exercise over study period

##Test sample = % of fat lost by dieting over study period

##Ha = %fat_diet > %fat_exercise

##H0 = %fat_diet <= %fat_exercise
 
 
Do American trust the president? POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

##H0 = Assuming a 'yes' response to the poll question "From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?" is an indication of trust, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of 'yes' responses is less than or equal to 'no' response, within a significance of 5%.

##Ha = %yes > %no

##H0 = %yes <= %no
 
 
Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

#H0= The percentage of cessation rates of former smokers that used the nicotine patch to quit smoking is the same or lower for candidates who participated in the placebo patch program as for the control group.

##Cessation rate = CR

##Ha: CR_nicotine > CR_placebo

##H0: CR_nicotine <= CR_placebo
 
 
Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

#H0= The IQ of children measured at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years is the same or lower than the IQ of children who had mothers that smoked during pregnancy as for the control group.

##H0_1: IQ_non_1 <= IQ_smoke_1 

##H0_2: IQ_non_2 <= IQ_smoke_2

##H0_3: IQ_non_3 <= IQ_smoke_3

##H0_4: IQ_non_4 <= IQ_smoke_4
