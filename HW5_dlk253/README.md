#HW5
This week I finally felt comfortable witht he realtionship between compute and github. It now makes sense to me and I have been able to push my data with no problems. On Friday I met with my group and we worked through assignment 1 and 2. The plotting is interestinga I was sometimes getting some obsecure visuals. The null hypothesis in all my cases for assignment 2 was rejected.I am also taking a deep dive into the online stats book and it is helpful. I have never taken a stats course before so I need to catch up on knowledge of distributions and the relevant equations. 

#Assignment 1 and Assignment 2
For these first two assignments I worked with Jon Toy, Bailey Griswold, Christian Rosado, and Adrian Dahlin. We were all pretty comfortable with this one and it again was super helpful to work with the group. As the artist in the group I am the outlier and am often asking questions and having a little trouble keeping up but the group is very good at explaining things and I am learning so much.
After the work session I went right to my stats book and started reading.
