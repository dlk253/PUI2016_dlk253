#Data Viz using plt. to show city bike trip duration data based on age and gender. This notebook was authored by dlk253 for PUI2016 HW7

##For this assignment I used the citybike data from May 2016. The figure represents trip duration based on age and gender for citibike riders during May 2016. By zooming in on rides that are less than 20 minutes it can be seen that there is a pretty even distribution of gender based on trip diruation, regardless of the age. When considering both males and females over the age of 70, it can be concluded that very trips (those that are > 5 minutes are being taken). I used the dots as a way to show the individual instances of the trip, instead of a bar graph, this works only when the data is zoomed way in.
