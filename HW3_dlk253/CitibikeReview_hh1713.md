The null and the alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly. It would have been helpful to maybe state the idea clearer in the idea section and the reasoning behind it (the reasoning behind stating the null that way) to give insight and make it easier to evaluate the null.

The data supports the project. Nice job getting the data to show you what you want with the morning/evening columns. The tables could have used some cleaning up so irrelevant data wasn't hanging around. Also the plots were missing information (titles, axis...) so it took me some time to understand them (but I am also slow!)

A t-test seems to make sence here as you are looking at differences between two groups.

Nice job by the way!
Best,
