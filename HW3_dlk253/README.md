
#My Level of Participation / my Contributions to each assignment. 
##Assignment  1
For assignment 1 went throuth the code that was posted in the ipython notebook by the professor. It was pretty straightforard. I receieve some of the code from student Greg Mayes, but ended up doing most of the project myself. I used a website scipy.org for many of the distributions.

##Assignment 2
For this assignment Baily Griswold reaced out to a bunch of us about organizing a weekly Friday meet up. Because I have access to MAGNET facilites I was 
able to book us a room (817) every friday from 6:30 to 10pm. This past friday about ten people showed up to work on the city bike problem 
for part two of the assignment. I was able to help decide which hypothesis and null hypothesis to tackle. I aslo set up a whats app group for the Friday meet up. 
I was more of an observer when it came to the code and Baily Griswold and Enrique really helped with the code and they shared their code with me. 
It was super helpful to find group members that were able to hack through this. We all sat together at the Python workshop and looked over each otehrs shoulders 
to make sure the bugs were less frequent. 

##Assignment 3
For assignment 3, I hung out after the Python workshop and sat with Chrisitan Rosado, he was super helpful and walked me through the equations and helped me 
figure out how to transforma my list into a Z status to determine the confidence interfval. After the workshop I was able to get the list going and input the equation,
however my equation needed help. Christian also helped out with what to look for in terms of the interpretatoin so I could go beyond the description.
