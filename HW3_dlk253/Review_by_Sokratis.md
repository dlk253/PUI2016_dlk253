The hypothesis is formulated clearly. Maybe a small comment could be that the tested time intervals (_7-10am and 4-7pm_)
mainly account for commuters and not the general population. It would be great if this was included in the idea or the 
hypothesis formulation, as well as the testing time horizon (_i.e. February 2015_) :)

The data are loaded and pre-processed successfully (_i.e. extraction of starting time from timestamp_). There are several 
columns that could be dropped though, since they arent useful for the analysis (_just a suggestion to save memory!_). 
The histograms are a very good visualization method for the problem in hand, but some legends and description below the figures would 
be great!

This particular hypothesis targets to examine differences in __two__ ratios (_male/female in the morning and evening_). Since we have 
information regarding the population and not a sample of it, the appropriate test is the __Z-test__.  

Good job!
