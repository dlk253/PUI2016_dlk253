# Assignment 1
For this assignment I worked with Baily, Jon Toy, and Enrique. We worked throught he first part on Sunday afternoon. I had some trouble plotting the last part of the assignment and became a little lost on the last five steps. My log was not plotting any lines, so there may be a mistake earlier in the code.

My big breakthrough with this assignment was properly figuring out how to assign the PUIdata and store the data that I downloaded from a CSV in the PUIdata directory. This seemed so complicated before, but now it is easier.

#Assignment 2 
Authorea article: https://www.authorea.com/users/105835/articles/133675/_show_article
For the Authorea article I worked with Jon Toy, Tyler Woebkenberg, and Christian Rosado. For HW3 I was working with two groups, it was more practical for me to do the Authorea article with the second group consisting of Jon, Tyler, and Christian. In response to the Authorea article I reworked the citibike notebook which can be found here:

The notebook fits the authorea article. This was also a great way to review for the midterm. I used some of the code found in Jons and Christians Homework, but wrote the majority of it by myself. It was also another way to practice the PUIdata enviornmental varible to download the CSV file.
