# Assignment 1
For this assignment I worked with Baily, Jon Toy, and Enrique. We worked throught he first part on Sunday afternoon. I had some trouble plotting the last part of the assignment and became a little lost on the last five steps. My log was not plotting any lines, so there may be a mistake earlier in the code.

My big breakthrough with this assignment was properly figuring out how to assign the PUIdata and store the data that I downloaded from a CSV in the PUIdata directory. This seemed so complicated before, but now it is easier.

#Assignment 2 
Authorea article: https://www.authorea.com/users/105835/articles/133675/_show_article
For the Authorea article I worked with Jon Toy, Tyler Woebkenberg, and Christian Rosado. For the groups at the time I was working with both groups and it was easier for me to do the Authorea article with this group. I reworked the HW3 citibike assignment to fit the authorea article, this was also a great way to review for the midterm. I used some of the code found in Christians Homework, but wrote the majority of it by myself. It was also another way to practice the PUIdata enviornmental varible to download the CSV file.
