#Assignment 1:
I was able to submit the pull request. The office hours with the professor were extremely helpful, I was having some merging issues between compute and git but those were resolved. Overall I think that the work done by my assigned classmate was solid, however the averages were not that detailed and the information did not explain that much. 


#Assignment 2:

For assignment 3 and assignment 4 I worked with Baily Griswold (bg1672), Tyler Woebkenburg (tw1574), Christian Rosado, and Jon Toy(jt2276). We had a big working group session on Friday from 6pm - 10pm. We projected the notebook and worked through it together. I was sitting between two very talented programs (Baily and Jon Toy) and was able to crunch through the assignment. Baily and Jon always have great suggestions for how to work with lists and run functions. Tyler was super useful as well and showed me how to clone a directory on compute. I showed everyone how to access and add files on compute. I really like working with this group and having the space at Magnet to work is a bonus. I am still pretty new at PYTHON, so working with this group has been awesome. 

My contributions are facilitating the space, booking the room and projecting my computer on the projector for everyone to follow along with. Group coding is the best!
