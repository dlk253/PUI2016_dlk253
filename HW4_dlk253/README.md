#Assignment 1:

I was able to submit the pull request. The office hours with the professor were extremely helpful, I was having some merging issues between compute and git but those were resolved. 


#Assignment 2:

For the this part of the assignment I collaborated with Greg Mayes (gsm317). The article I selected was "Does Gender Influence ColourChoice in Treatment of Visual Stress? The article Greg selected was, "The Queen and I: Neural Correlates of Altered Self-Related Cognitions in Major Depressive Episode." In my article the authors used the Chi-square test to determine that there was no
significant association between the colour of overlay chosen and male or female gender. In Greg's analysis of the Queen and I, the authors used a t-test to determine that there was no significant difference between the age of the groups and that the BDI-II and Rosenberg scores differed significantly between the two groups. He also went on to fin that the participants where shown a series of positive, negative and neutral stimulus words in three rounds (self, queen, case). The answers either were in relation to themselvse or the Queen of England. The 'case' condition was answered based on if the stimulus word was shown in lower or upper case letters and was used as control for fMRI BOLD response. In the results, a 3-way ANOVA test was used for response time with group (control or depressed), category (self, queen, case) and valence (positive, negative, neutural). Linear regression was used between response time (self - queen) and positivity measure against the BDI-II and Rosenberg to determine if the measures were related to depressive symptoms. Comparasons between groups were done using a t-test for all nine conditions (categories x valences). A general linear model was constructed between the same nine regressions and fMRI response.


| **Statistical Analyses | Chi_Square | Linear Regression, 3-Way ANOVA, T-test |
| ---|---|---|
| IV(s) | Gender(male, female, and gender neutral) | Positive, negative and neutral stimulus words |
| IV type(s) | Categorical | Categorical Nominal | 
| DV(s) | Color of Overlay (approximately 30 colors)   | Percentage of responses answered 'yes;' Response time (self - queen); 'Positivity Measure' defined as % response 'yes' to positive words subtracted by % response 'yes' to negative words; Functional-MRI Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response  |
| DV type(s) | Categorical  | Continous Ratio; Continuous Interval; Continous Ratio; Continuous Interval |
| Control Var | Neutral Overlay Color; Age | Major Depressive; Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II); Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory |
| Control Var Types | Categorical; Continuous | Categorical Dichotomous; Continuous Interval; Continuous Interval |
| Question to be Answered | Does Gender Influence Colour Choice in the Treatment of Visual Stress? | Do self-related negative thoughts in people suffering a Major Depressive Episode effect brain activity in an fMRI |
| H0 | Ranks test groups <= Ranks control group | Depressed fMRI BOLD response <= Control fMRI BOLD response |
| alpha | p < 0.15 | p < 0.005 |

On a side note the colors used in the graphs were highly geneder biased visualizations. Which despite the chi square test, this made me think that the whole entire article was full of bias. 

#Assignment 3 and assignment 4 

I worked with Baily Griswold (bg1672), Tyler Woebkenburg (tw1574), Christian Rosado, and Jon Toy(jt2276). We had a big working group session on Friday from 6pm - 10pm. We projected the notebook and worked through it together. I was sitting between two very talented programs (Baily and Jon Toy) and was able to crunch through the assignment. Baily and Jon always have great suggestions for how to work with lists and run functions. Tyler was super useful as well and showed me how to clone a directory on compute. I showed everyone how to access and add files on compute. I really like working with this group and having the space at Magnet to work is a bonus. I am still pretty new at PYTHON, so working with this group has been awesome. 

My contributions are facilitating the space, booking the room and projecting my computer on the projector for everyone to follow along with. Group coding is the best!
