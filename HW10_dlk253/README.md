For Homework 10 I worked with Baily Griswold and Christian Rosado. We took turns projecting our computers at MAGNET and worked through the lab. We basically just created winter and summer data based on the notebook created by Sina in class. The hardest part was figuring out how to merge and wrangle the dataframes. After we extracted the summer and winter data, it was pretty straightforward in terms of replacing what Sina had started. I enjoyed this lab and the enthuasium that Sina brought to the subject.
