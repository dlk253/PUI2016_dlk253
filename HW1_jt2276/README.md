# HW1_jt2276

I worked alone during this assignments, and thus used a second account to test both making and accepting pull requests. I plan to reach out to my classmates to work collaboratively on future assignments.

#Assignment Overview:

In this assignment I created a directory on the compute server and then created a shortcut of its path using an enviromental variable and a shortcut to go directly to that path using an alias. I saved both of these shortcuts to the .bashrc file that is accessed every time upon login, so that I will be able to continue to use these shortcuts. The proof of this can be found in the following screenshots showing the .bashrc file and the environmental variable/alias execution.

I then created a repository on the remote server, created a second repository on the local server, created this README markdown file on the local server, and then linked the two repositories.
