#Homework 2 Readme File
##For this assignment I made the HW2 directory on my local machine and pushed it to the PUI2016 repo. Then in class I was able to recieve help and connected my compute directory to my git repro so from this point on I will do things on compute. The TA was very helpful. 


# Collaborators
For this homework I received help on just the Assignment #1 part from Greg Mayes (gsm317) who is in the Thursday section of the class. Greg helped me get up and running with the python script and gave me the code to load in the api and to get the keys from the api. I then figured out Assignment #2 and #3. I still need help with the plotting section of assignment #3 but was able to pull in the CSV file from the cusp data set with the help of the professor. I went to her office hours on Monday that she added as special office hours. Because I attended these office hours I am supposed to receive an extension for this assignment. This was posted to the messages on NYU classes.


#Process
This assignment really made me learn Python and was difficult but satisfying. I was able to completely understand how to push and pull from git and also figure out how to work with data sets. The hardest part was getting the number of buses and putting the in the correct order with the proper lat and long. I was putting a loop inside a loop and that was incorrect. Federica helped me figure out how to use enumerate with the list and that solved my problem. thanks!

for i, it in enumerate(my_list):


By the time I got to the bus locations part of the assignment I felt more confident and actually had fun working with this part.

The last part of the assignment was the hardest for me becaue I know that I am so close. Here is my CSV file with some columns dropped.

I just need to figure out how to plot it and will visit office hours to get it done.
