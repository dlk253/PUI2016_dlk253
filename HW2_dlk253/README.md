#Homework 2 Readme File
##For this assignment I made the HW2 directory on my local machine and pushed it to the PUI2016 repo. 

It took me a few tries to figure out how to push from my machine to the git repo but I realized that I was pusching from the location of the file, not the directory the file was in. Basically I had my path wrong and kept on gettina branch error.
