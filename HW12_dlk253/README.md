For this Extra Credit Homework assignment I worked with Jon Toy and Christian Rosado. 

The sql component was fairly straightforward.Combining the datasets was very direct and involved processes that we have done before. 
Things for this task became interesting when we started to work with the sample semivariogram. The semivariogram was all over the place and was not a model of what is expected in a semivariogram. 
There is supposed to be a point where the model attains a range and it is supposed to flatten out, but ours did not. There was also a value of around 800000 which was throwing the model way off.
