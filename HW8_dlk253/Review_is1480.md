##Plot peer review by dlk253 for is1480
Principles of Urban informatics HW8

This plot has the basic elements such as clearly labeled axis, a legend, a title, rendered colors, and description. 

Suggested improvements would include 

#1.) Adding units to to the x axis. It is unclear if time of day is in hours, minutes or seconds.

#2.) For the Y axis, the number of rides would be more legible if it had a comma in the numbers such as 20,000, 30,000, etc. Or one possiblity would be to make this font smaller or abbreviate the thousands (20K, 30K, etc.) Adding all those zeros takes up space and simplifying this axis would make it more legible. 

#3.) Font size/contrast for the Y axis. The "Number of Rides" should be in a different font than the units, this will create hierarchy for the eye and it will be easier to read. I would suggest making the units a lighter font and the axis labels a darker or slightly larger font. This comment also applies to the x axis. 

#4.) Try messing around with line weights. The box around the legend is really heavy, make this about %25 of what you have now. You could also make the legend without a box, that might look more clean. 

#5.) The description of Fig 1. is where my eye is drawn to, which is fine, but you may want to put the emphasis on the plot. Try using a lighter font for the description of the figure. 
#6.) looking at the time of day again, I think this could be more clear. Maybe add a label for each hour, that might look nice. you could make the font smaller for the x axis and squeeze all the hours on. Right now the empahsis is on midnight, 5 am, 10 am, 3pm and 8pm, but all the hours are importatn for this analysis so these announced hours may be distracting.

Good luck and I hope to see some improvements on this. I had fun reviewing this because you gave me something good to start with.
