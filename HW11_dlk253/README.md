For this homework I worked on Assignment #1 with Christian Rosado, and received some help over whatsapp from Jon Toy. 
My PUIDATA envt variable is no longer working and the TA and I could not figure out why so I emailed cusp.it and they are looking into the issue.
I hope it will be up and running soon.

For assignment one I was able to plot the shapefile of Brooklyn for every ten polygons but was struggling with how to plot the point 
over the shapefile. This is probably a super trivial mistake that cost me too much time.

FOr assignment two I was having trouble downloading the census data, so I moved onto the JSON file. I was able to start working with 
the json dataframe but did not get very far with the kmeans clustering test. I found some examples but need a few more weeks to work through this.
